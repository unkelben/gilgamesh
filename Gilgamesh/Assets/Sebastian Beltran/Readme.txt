Enkidu Meets Shepherds - Tools Used

With having very little experience in Unity I had to spent the first couple of weeks catching up on how unity worked.
That is why most of my graphics where created with the following packages from the Unity Assets Store:

-Characters were created with CharacterCreator2D - IT gives you all the tools to create, dress and animate your characters.
-Background was created with 2D Platformer Tileset
-The Sheep was found at https://www.freepik.com/
-The lion was found at https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/65/66/cartoon-lion-roaring-vector-4446566.jpg
